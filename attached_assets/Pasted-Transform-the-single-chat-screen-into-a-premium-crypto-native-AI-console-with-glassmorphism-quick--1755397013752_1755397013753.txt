Transform the single chat screen into a premium, crypto-native AI console with glassmorphism, quick prompts, contextual widgets, and a thinking animation before (and during) replies. Keep current ChatGPT API usage; add UX polish + domain features.

Layout

Left (65%) — Chat Pane

Glass chat bubbles (user right-aligned, AI left-aligned), gradient borders.

Sticky composer with attachment icon (future), input, Send.

Right (35%) — Context Pane

Live Cards auto-swap based on chat context:

Price card (token symbol → price, 24h %, sparkline).

Whale leaderboard (top wallets, short addr, last move).

Alert rules (list + toggle).

Chain switcher pills: All / ETH / AVAX / Subnets (status dot).

Quick Prompts (chips): “Top Whale Moves”, “Wallet Risk Check”, “AI Market Prediction”, “Explain in Simple Words”.

Motion & “Thinking” Behavior

On Send:

Insert a ‘Thinking…’ message placeholder from the AI with:

Animated avatar glow (pulse).

Three bouncing dots (…).

Sub-caption: “Analyzing on-chain, social & price signals…”

Keep it for 900–1500 ms (randomized) before streaming text starts.

Stream reply character-by-character (50–70ms per token feel) with a soft typewriter effect.

When finished, replace dots with a subtle success shimmer on the bubble edge.

While streaming:

Show mini progress bar on bubble top (indeterminate).

Allow Stop button; if clicked, show truncated reply + “Stopped” tag.

Visual System

Dark cyberpunk + glass: bg-white/10, backdrop-blur-md, border-white/20, soft shadow.

Animated gradient orbs in background (indigo→purple→teal→green).

Buttons hover: scale 1.05, border glow, subtle ripple.

Chat bubbles hover: 2° 3D tilt + deeper shadow.

Intelligence Features (hooked to prompts/intents; keep API calls same)

Intent detection (basic keyword/regex on client is fine):

price <symbol> → show Price Card in Context Pane.

wallet <address> → render Wallet Profile: holdings summary, tx volume, risk score (Low/Med/High).

top whales / whale → Whale Leaderboard widget.

set alert / notify → show Create Alert Drawer (rule name, condition, channel). Persist locally if backend not ready.

explain / ELI5 → re-prompt model with “simplify” instruction and show Simplified View toggle on bubble.

AI Confidence Ring on each AI bubble (small radial gauge 0–100).

Copy / Save actions on AI messages (copy, pin to notes).

Avalanche Angle (if chain = AVAX / Subnets)

Context Pane adds Subnet Heatmap mini-card (bubbles sized by wallets/tx in last 24h).

Quick Prompt chip: “🔺 Avalanche Whale Inflows”.

Explorer icons: Snowtrace for tx/hash/address.

System Messages (top of chat)

Rotating taglines every 4s (cross-fade, scale 0.98→1):

“Your AI Whale Tracker 🐋”

“Stay Ahead of Smart Money 💸”

“Predict. Protect. Profit.”

Empty & Error States

First-time view: 3 big Quick Prompts + subtle arrow nudging input.

Rate limit/API error: show friendly toast + auto-retry chip (“Retry with shorter query”).

Network drop: status pill (red → yellow → green) with reconnect spinner.

Accessibility & Perf

Keyboard: Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline; focus rings visible.

ARIA live region for streaming text (polite).

prefers-reduced-motion: disable typewriter & shimmer, keep instant text.

Lazy-load widgets; cache last reply & widgets per session.

Acceptance Criteria (must pass)

On every user send, a Thinking placeholder appears before any text, with bouncing dots & avatar glow.

Replies stream visibly; Stop button works.

Quick Prompts insert canned queries and trigger the right widgets.

Chain pills filter widgets (AVAX shows Snowtrace links; Subnets show heatmap card).

Confidence Ring renders on AI bubbles.

Page looks premium (glassmorphism, gradient orbs, hover tilt), responsive 360–1440, no layout shift.
